# Editorial
Adds an Editorial block to Omeka Exhibits for private commentary and discussion of Exhibits in progress.

## Installation

Install in the usual Omeka way.

The plugin creates a new role, Exhibit-contributor, which inherits permissions from the Contributor role and adds access to editing Exhibits based on user options.

## Usage

The plugin adds an 'Editorial Block' to the available Exhibit layouts. This block allows for the creator to make a comment regarding the exhibit page, and allows the block creator to grant access to that block so others can follow up with responses and discussion. Anyone with access to that block has the option to send email notifications about significant changes as work progresses.
